```

# NOTE
These examples demonstrate how to use the cmdlets provided by the AzureAndADValidation module to confirm the existence and configuration of various Azure and Active Directory resources.

# TROUBLESHOOTING NOTE

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Authentication Errors
**Symptom**: You receive an authentication error when running cmdlets that interact with Azure resources.

**Solution**: Ensure that you are logged in to your Azure account using the `Connect-AzAccount` cmdlet. If you are using a service principal, verify that the service principal has the necessary permissions to access the resources.

```powershell
Connect-AzAccount
```

### Issue 2: Resource Not Found
**Symptom**: A cmdlet returns an error indicating that a specified resource could not be found.

**Solution**: Verify that the resource name and resource group name are correct. Use the Azure portal or the `Get-AzResource` cmdlet to list available resources and confirm their names. Ensure that you have the correct subscription context set if you are working with multiple Azure subscriptions.

```powershell
# List all resources in a specific resource group
Get-AzResource -ResourceGroupName "MyResourceGroup"

# Set the correct subscription context
Select-AzSubscription -SubscriptionId "YourSubscriptionId"
```

### Issue 3: Insufficient Permissions
**Symptom**: You receive an error indicating insufficient permissions when attempting to validate or access a resource.

**Solution**: Ensure that your account or service principal has the necessary role assignments and permissions. You can use the `Get-AzRoleAssignment` cmdlet to check your current role assignments. If necessary, assign the appropriate role using the `New-AzRoleAssignment` cmdlet.

```powershell
# Check current role assignments for a user
Get-AzRoleAssignment -ObjectId (Get-AzADUser -UserPrincipalName "user@domain.com").Id

# Assign a role to a user
New-AzRoleAssignment -ObjectId (Get-AzADUser -UserPrincipalName "user@domain.com").Id -RoleDefinitionName "Contributor" -Scope "/subscriptions/YourSubscriptionId"
```

### Issue 4: Network Connectivity
**Symptom**: Cmdlets fail due to network connectivity issues.

**Solution**: Ensure that your machine has a stable internet connection and can reach Azure services. You can use the Test-NetConnection cmdlet to diagnose network issues. Verify that there are no firewall or proxy settings blocking the connection.

```powershell
# Test network connectivity to Azure
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName "www.azure.com"

# Test network connectivity to a specific Azure service endpoint
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName "management.azure.com" -Port 443
```
